# DataAnalysis
## This Project is...
Data Science Projects Using Python <br/> 
This repository is a place to share my code and notebooks for numerous data science projects. <br/>
Many of these projects are written up on my [Blog page](https://0ver-grow.tistory.com/)

In this project, we start with basic data analysis and then we start with actual data analysis using public data.

## let's start this project
1. git clone "https://github.com/LEEJUNB/DataAnalysis.git"
2. Download the data file from url in cell 1.
3. Jupyter Notebook > Cell > Run All

## In this project, I recorded the following: 
1. Utilized Data
- Apartment
- Downtown
- Analysis of Franchisees
- Store location comparison
- Urban Park Data
2. Use Techniques
- seaborn, scatterplot, folium, Heatmap, CircleMarker 
- missingno

## Next step.
1. Analyzing Financial Data with Python
- Basic Financial Analysis
- Derivative analysis
<br/>
2. Python Machine Learning Perfect Guide
- Using AI Library : scikit learn, tensorflow, pytorch
- Classification, LinearRegression, Dimension Reduction, Cluster
- NLP, Surprise
<br/>
3. Data Science Training Book
<br/>
