# DataAnalysis
Data Science Projects Using Python <br/> 
This repository is a place to share my code and notebooks for numerous data science projects. <br/>
Many of these projects are written up on my [Blog page](https://0ver-grow.tistory.com/)

In this project, we start with basic data analysis and then we start with actual data analysis using public data.
